# Open-source library request manager
> *This repo is meant as a place to share open source library ideas with other developers.*

* If you have an idea for a new library but don't have the time or skills to develop it, simply create a new issue.
* If you're searching for ideas to implement a new library just search the open issues.

##Rules
1. Requests **must** be *tagged* with its *programming language/framework*. (If a tag for a specific language is missing just comment on [this issue](/) [TODO] and I'll add the tag.)
2. Requests **must** contain a clear *description*. Screenshots/mockups/API-specs are *optional* but recommended.
3. Requests that have made it to an actual library will be closed to make it easier for other devs to find ideas that aren't already "taken".
4. Invalid requests will be marked `invalid` until they are fixed.
