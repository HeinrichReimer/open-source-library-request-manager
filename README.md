# Open-source library request manager
> #### A place to share ideas for open source library with other developers.

* If you have an _idea for a new library_ but don't have the time or skills to develop it, simply [**create a new issue**][2].
* If you're _searching for ideas_ to implement a new library just search the [**open issues**][3].

## Rules
1. Requests **must** contain a clear and descriptive *title*.
1. Requests **must** contain a clear *description*. Screenshots/links/mockups/API-specs are *optional* but recommended.
2. Requests **must** define at least one related *programming language* or *framework* in their description. The request will be tagged according to this information. (If a tag for a specific language is missing just comment on [*this issue*][1] and I'll add the tag.)
3. Requests that have made it to an actual library will be *closed* to make it easier for other devs to find ideas that aren't already "taken".
4. *Invalid* requests will be marked `invalid` until they are fixed.
