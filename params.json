Requests **must** contain a clear and descriptive *title*.\r\n1. Requests **must** contain a clear *description*. Screenshots/links/mockups/API-specs are *optional* but recommended.\r\n2. Requests **must** define at least one related *programming language* or *framework* in their description. The request will be tagged according to this information. (If a tag for a specific language is missing just comment on [*this issue*][1] and I'll add the tag.)\r\n3. Requests that have made it to an actual library will be *closed* to make it easier for other devs to find ideas that aren't already \"taken\".\r\n4. *Invalid* requests will be marked `invalid` until they are fixed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/HeinrichReimer/open-source-library-request-manager/issues/1\r\n[2]: https://github.com/HeinrichReimer/open-source-library-request-manager/issues/new\r\n[3]: https://github.com/HeinrichReimer/open-source-library-request-manager/issues\r\n",
